> * Knowledge of how to use the Command Prompt
>
> If you are feeling brave, feel free to do the following:
> * Ask for help in the Endless Sky discord server.
> * ~~Copy-paste untrusted dangerous commands from Stack Overflow.~~
> * Pray to Freya Winters and convince Her to help you install Winters.
> * Use ~~Arch~~ ~~Debian~~ ~~openSUSE~~ ~~Slackware~~ Ubuntu.
